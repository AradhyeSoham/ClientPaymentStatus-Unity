# ClientPaymentStatus-Unity
Working as a freelancer? Having troubles with clients not paying you after you've done the work?
Just add this script, create a Realtime Database with Firebase and link the json url of the int value with the script's DB_URL and attach a gameObject covering the screen to the canvas.
Voila!

Thank me later!
